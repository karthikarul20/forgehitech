                                <div>
                                    Home Automation enables the automatic control of commonly used elements such as lighting, security, temperature, music and other home devices in a manner that is personalized to the needs of each family. Automated homes are referred to as "Smart Homes".Making your home into a smart home can mean a lot of things.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Convenience: An automated home is about the convenience of saving your time and effort by having your home automatically do routine functions such as watering your grass (but only if it has not rained recently) or turning off all lights, setting the thermostat to economy mode and arming the security system when you retire for the night. Its about enjoying home theater time by having the lights dim, curtains close, TV and DVD player turn on and popcorn popper start... all with the touch of just one button.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Security: Home automation is about the security you have knowing that you can look in on your home remotely from anywhere in the world, or that your home will phone you if anything is a miss, or that a fire
                                            will alert your home to wake you, shut down the gas and ventilation system and turn on a lighting path for your escape.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Savings: Its about the energy savings you will enjoy by assigning your home the responsibility of regulating the operation of lights, water heater, HVAC system, entertainment components, appliances and
                                            irrigation system so these devices are on only when needed. The benefits of an automated home are only limited by your imagination.

                                    </ul>

                                <h2>Lighting Control</h2>
                                <div>
                                        A lighting control  system  enables  one-touch  control  of  all  lights  throughout  the  house  using  mood-based  scenes which can be created resulting in convenience and elegance. With the touch of a button, you can turn lights on or off, dim lights, control fans and more from anywhere in the house. VR Tech designs and installs wired and wireless lighting control  systems  personalized  to  the  needs  of  each  family.  Lighting  control  systems  can  be  programmed easily based on time of day, motion, security, mood, and many other factors. For example, with a lighting control system you can program your lights to automatically turn on when you enter the house or turn off during nights or when you leave the house. You can program lighting scenes consistent with a relaxing evening, a late night party or a holiday dinner. Lighting control systems do not take away from your ability to control individual lights the way you have always done.                                    <ul>
                                        The following are some examples of the benefits of a lighting control system.

                                            Lighting Moods: Contribute  to  providing  the  right  blend  of  natural  lighting  and  indoor  lighting;  for example, curtains can automatically be opened in the morning to allow light into the home, closed during the day hours to conserve energy, opened in the evening hours to enjoy views or allow for fresh air and then closed again at  night for  privacy. Automation  of  curtains makes the  opening  and  closing  of  curtains  convenient  and  enables home owners to enjoy the benefits of natural lighting.
