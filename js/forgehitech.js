Its about enjoying home theater time by having the lights dim, curtains close, TV and DVD player turn on and popcorn popper start... all with the touch of just one button.</li>"

Multi room audio systems enable home owners to listen to their favorite audio everywhere around the house and also in the garden. A multi room audio system can deliver music from one central source (media server) or from distributed sources (such as iPods that can feed music in various rooms). Since each person in the house is going to have his or her own tastes and preferences, a multi room audio system will be able to deliver different sources simultaneously to different rooms. Conversely, when you're entertaining or just as you're moving around your house, you might want your system to be playing the same synchronized source to every zone in the house.

The wall mounted Volume and Source Control (VSC) features an easy-to-use turn knob for music selection and volume control and also acts as an infrared repeater for source component control. Remote Input Modules (RIMs) can be located throughout the house to pick up music from your home theater, kitchen, TV, computer, personal music player, satellite, radio, Media Center, CD player- any source with an audio output.
